# andorlando.github.io

My website! Check it out [here](https://andorlando.github.io/) Written using vanilla javascript
and that's basically it. It also has a little custom static site generation thing made for the
markdown so I can get good SEO (and not because Pratyush bullied me I promise).

**TODO:**
- [ ] demos
- [ ] about
- [ ] resume
- [ ] make homepage actually pick a quadrant instead of just being 3
- [x] make it load the quadrant with javascript faster by doing the placement bit with `<script>`
- [ ] better inline code rendering in blogs
- [ ] collapsable blog headers
- [ ] mobile support
