Complaining about Math 235

I figure I should get it out there for everyone who cares to listen.

As of writing this it's been about 6 months and I'm still not over it.
Here's the basic rundown:
- I got a B+ in Linear Algebra in my first semester of college.
- I got a A- in Linear Algebra at Harvard in my Junior year of high school.
- ??? how ???

So the A- I get. There was a midterm where I messed up the definitions
of image and kernel, I was a Junior and I was already swamped in work
and I tried my hardest so I can excuse it.

In college yeah I definitely didn't take the class that seriously, but
it really didn't matter. I didn't go to class but I still got a 95% on
the first midterm, a 98% on the second and was set to get an A as long
as I got above a 75% on the final.

Since I got a B+ you can imagine what happened.

I probably could have studied a bit more, I'm sure if I had went to class
it might have gone a little better, but on the other hand it probably wasn't
even that in the first place.

You see, I had literally a single (1) one 0b000001 0x01 uno .---- **one**
hour of sleep the night before. I don't think it was nerves, maybe it was
because I was sick or something? And then before the hour 30 long linear
test I actually also had an hour 30 long multi test. Even still, I answered
all the questions with confidence and even checked my work multiple times.

The worst part? To this day I still don't know what I got wrong. I've gotten
back 26 points worth of regrade requests before so it's not like there wasn't
a non-zero chance I could get points back if I could actually see the test,
**but they didn't let me!!** To this day I still haven't seen that test! I
don't think I ever will! I'm writing this the summer after Freshman year
and at this point in time I would have literally a perfect GPA if not for
that one single day where the entire heavens aligned to make sure I wouldn't
be able to have a 4.0 in college.

Anyways I'm still salty. If you're a job wondering why my gpa is 3.94 and not
4.0 this is why. I know how to do linear algebra I promise. Ugh.
