## he doesn't actually have any
This is a developer blog. Every self-respecting developer has one of these
(unless you're a recruiter who doesn't, in which case only **most** 
self-respecting developers have one of these). Since it's hosted on github pages,
everything you see here is homemade, including this markdown parser. Honestly
most of the reason I made this in the first place is for the  **stupid stuff**
section because all my official projects have `README.md`s.

### categories
- **school:** stuff about college
- **projects:** all of my projects
- **stupid stuff:** a bunch of smaller projects/stupid stuff I've written

This is a pretty short home page but hopefully it'll fill out as I think of
more  things to write
