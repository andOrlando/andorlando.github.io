<p>I figure I should get it out there for everyone who cares to listen.</p>
<p>As of writing this it&#39;s been about 6 months and I&#39;m still not over it.
Here&#39;s the basic rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>I got a B+ in Linear Algebra in my first semester of college.</li>
<li>I got a A- in Linear Algebra at Harvard in my Junior year of high school.</li>
<li>??? how ???</li>
</ul>
<p>So the A- I get. There was a midterm where I messed up the definitions
of image and kernel, I was a Junior and I was already swamped in work
and I tried my hardest so I can excuse it.</p>
<p>In college yeah I definitely didn&#39;t take the class that seriously, but
it really didn&#39;t matter. I didn&#39;t go to class but I still got a 95% on
the first midterm, a 98% on the second and was set to get an A as long
as I got above a 75% on the final.</p>
<p>Since I got a B+ you can imagine what happened.</p>
<p>I probably could have studied a bit more, I&#39;m sure if I had went to class
it might have gone a little better, but on the other hand it probably wasn&#39;t
even that in the first place.</p>
<p>You see, I had literally a single (1) one 0b000001 0x01 uno .---- <strong>one</strong>
hour of sleep the night before. I don&#39;t think it was nerves, maybe it was
because I was sick or something? And then before the hour 30 long linear
test I actually also had an hour 30 long multi test. Even still, I answered
all the questions with confidence and even checked my work multiple times.</p>
<p>The worst part? To this day I still don&#39;t know what I got wrong. I&#39;ve gotten
back 26 points worth of regrade requests before so it&#39;s not like there wasn&#39;t
a non-zero chance I could get points back if I could actually see the test,
<strong>but they didn&#39;t let me!!</strong> To this day I still haven&#39;t seen that test! I
don&#39;t think I ever will! I&#39;m writing this the summer after Freshman year
and at this point in time I would have literally a perfect GPA if not for
that one single day where the entire heavens aligned to make sure I wouldn&#39;t
be able to have a 4.0 in college.</p>
<p>Anyways I&#39;m still salty. If you&#39;re a job wondering why my gpa is 3.94 and not
4.0 this is why. I know how to do linear algebra I promise. Ugh.</p>
