<h2>he doesn&#39;t actually have any</h2>
<p>This is a developer blog. Every self-respecting developer has one of these
(unless you&#39;re a recruiter who doesn&#39;t, in which case only <strong>most</strong> 
self-respecting developers have one of these). Since it&#39;s hosted on github pages,
everything you see here is homemade, including this markdown parser. Honestly
most of the reason I made this in the first place is for the  <strong>stupid stuff</strong>
section because all my official projects have <code>README.md</code>s.</p>
<h3>categories</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>school:</strong> stuff about college</li>
<li><strong>projects:</strong> all of my projects</li>
<li><strong>stupid stuff:</strong> a bunch of smaller projects/stupid stuff I&#39;ve written</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a pretty short home page but hopefully it&#39;ll fill out as I think of
more  things to write
 </p>
