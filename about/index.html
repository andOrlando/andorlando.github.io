      <h1>about me</h1>
      <p>
I'm Bennett Gillig, a Computer Science and Computer Engineering junior at UMass Amherst.
I'm generally pretty obsessed with coding, or like creating good code specifically. To that
end feel free to look at any of my projects and you'll see plenty of lines that aren't 
technically optimally formatted but they look cooler. Or just look at the sheer quantity of
my projects--I don't honestly enjoy too many things more than I do spending hours coding while
listening to niche rhythm-game edm.
      </p><p>
Aside from that I'm a big NixOS enthusiast and I honestly can't see myself using anything else
for the rest of my life unless basically a direct upgrade supplants it. Fully reproducible machine
configuration is such a boon for understanding what's happening on my laptop.
      </p><p>
I guess all this leads to kind of the core of who I am as a person--I min-max basically everything.
Be it code quality, my own desktop (check out my awesomeWM configuration in my nixos-dotfiles), my
computer itself and really everything else.
      </p><p>
This page is in progress, I'll give it circles like everything else at some point soon
